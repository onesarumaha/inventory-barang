# Contributing to Reza Admin

Please take a moment to review this document in order to make contribution process easy and effective for everyone involved.

## Issues and Labels
This is label to help organize and identify issues. Here's what they represent and how we use them:
- ```browser bug``` - Issues that are reported to us, but actually are the result of a browser-spesific bug. These are diagnosed with reduced test cases and result in an issues openend on that browser's own bug tacker.
- ```confirmed``` - Issues that have been confirmed with a reduced test case and identify a bug in Reza Admin.
- ```css``` - Issues stemming from our compiled CSS or source SCSS files.
- ```docs``` - Issues for improving or updating our documentation.
- ```feature``` - Issues asking for a new feature to be added, or an existing one to be extended or modified.
- ```js``` - Issues stemming from our compiled or source JavaScript files.

## Bug Reports
Guidelines for bug reports:
1. **Use the GitHub issue search** - check if the issue has already been reported.
2. **Check if the issue has been fixed**
3. **Isolate the problem** - ideally create a [reduced test cases](https://css-tricks.com/reduced-test-cases/) and a live example.

A good bug report shouldn't leave others needing to chase you up for more information. Please try to be as detailed as possible in your report. What is your environment? What steps will reproduce the issue? What browser(s) and OS experience the problem? Do other browsers show the bug differently? What would you expect to be the outcome? All these details will help people to fix any potential bugs.
